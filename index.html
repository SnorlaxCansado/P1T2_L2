            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Gabriel Santos, an aspiring developer with a passion for Computer Science.</p>
            <p>Although I'm a reserved person, I'm always open to new friendships. I approach life with common sense, humor, and optimism.</p>
            <p><strong>Education and Interests:</strong> I began my academic journey in Economics and History but found my true passion in Computer Science. My hobbies reflect my introspective nature; I love reading, listening to, and playing music, with a special fondness for samba and playing the drums.</p>
            <p><strong>International Experience:</strong> I recently returned from Portugal, where I lived for almost five years. During that time, I studied History at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Porto. To support my studies and stay, I worked as a tour guide, in bars, and at a real estate company.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal and Professional Development:</strong> The challenges and experiences I've faced, both professionally and personally, have significantly contributed to my growth and helped me develop a great capacity for empathy.</p>
            <p><strong>Professional Objective:</strong> I'm currently seeking to establish my career as a developer. I'm eager to apply my knowledge in Computer Science, contributing to innovative and challenging projects. Despite my lack of experience, I'm always ready and interested in learning.</p>
